# nqueen
A non-optimal algorithm to solve "N Queens" problem. Read more about this problem at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).
## Description
In `utilities.py` file, I have defined a few functions. The most important one is `queen_is_safe` function that checks if is it safe to place a queen in a specific position. In `nqueen.py` file I have defined `find_all_placements` functions which returns a list of 2d lists. Each 2d list is one possible sulotion.
## Problems
The whole sulotion is non-optimal and works fine until n is less than 10. I have to imporove existing sulotion as possible and find better sulotions at future.
Also, I have written lots of redundant code which I have to get rid of.
## Contribute
If you can help me with optimizing the functions, I will be grateful.
